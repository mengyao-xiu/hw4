"Give me an ice-cream!"
There are multiple icecreams with different flavors dropping down from the top!
The player needs to get the same color as the picture shown on the top right of the screen.
Try to get the right flavor!
The players are able to move the place of the cone at the bottom.
Each player has 3 chances.
I would add putting sound when the sushi drops down on the plate correctly.
I would add ouch sound when the sushi is not on the plate.
There should be a notification on the top right of the screen shows the number of chance.
After 3 chances, there will be a game over sound.
