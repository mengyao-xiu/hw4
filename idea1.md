"Sushi"
The sushi game aims to let the players put the sushi on the plate by control the place of the sushi.
the plate is on the conveyor belt
the conveyor belt is moving
the player needs to adjust the position of the sushi according to the place of the plateso that it can falls down on the plate
the sushi is dropping down in constant speed
I would add putting sound when the sushi drops down on the plate correctly.
I would add ouch sound when the sushi is not on the plate
there should be a notification on the top right of the screen shows the number of chance
after 3 chances, there will be a game over sound
